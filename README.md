# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Time spent: **4-5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pawnder** is an Android app designed for dog lovers. The app features a similar layout to Tinder and allows users to swipe through dog profiles and connect with other dog owners. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üê∂üíïüì±

## Notes

I enjoyed working on this project and learned a lot about using ConstraintLayouts to create responsive layouts. One challenge I faced was figuring out how to create custom shape drawables for the buttons. I was able to find a helpful tutorial online that walked me through the process.
